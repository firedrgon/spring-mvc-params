=================

Spring RequestHandler method parameter injection.

This project provides two annotations for injecting Spring context beans into method parameters when the method is annotated with Spring MVC's RequestHandler annotation.

Spring already provides injection for many types of method parameters, but these annotations allows you to add your own without writing additional method argument resolvers.
